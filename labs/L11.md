## Overview

(Python) Lab on Graphs and Matrix Operations.



## Problems


1. Define an adjacency matrix for a graph with four vertices and five edges.

	```
	Sample adjacency matrix:
	[[0, 1, 1, 0],
	[1, 0, 1, 1],
	[1, 1, 0, 1],
	[0, 1, 1, 0]]
	```


2. Implement a function to multiply two matrices. Ensure it works for non-square matrices.

3. Provide an example where matrix multiplication is not commutative and explain why.

4. Implement a function to transpose a matrix.

5. Transpose the matrix from #1 using the function from #4.

6. Write a function to calculate the number of walks of a given length between two vertices in a graph.


7. Using the adjacency matrix from question #1, find the number of walks of length three from vertex 1 to vertex 3.

8.  Calculate the number of walks of length two from vertex 2 to vertex 4 using the adjacency matrix from question 1.

9. Write a function to check if there is a walk of length $k$ between two vertices in a graph.

10. Using the adjacency matrix from question #1, check if there is a walk of length $4$ from vertex $4$ to vertex $4$.

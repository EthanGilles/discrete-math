## Overview

Continue working with discrete mathematics concepts including prime numbers, divisibility, and summation.

## Learning Objectives
* Code functions to return computed quantities
* Verify equations based on summation formulas
* Test divisibility properties


## Problems

1. Find the quotient $q$ and remainder $r$ for each of the following values of $n$ and $d$ where $n = nq + r$.<br>
	* $n = 54, d = 4$	
	* $n = 37, d = 3$
	* $n = 54, d = 70$<br>

2. Given a positive integer $n > 1$, find a list of its prime factors and their powers.  For example, if $n = 60$, you will have two lists, `p = [2,3,5]` and `e = [2,1,1]` where `p` are the prime factors and `e` are the corresponding exponents.  You may use prime functions from previous labs.  Coding Hint: One strategy is to start with an empty list `x` and append to it using `x.append(y)` where `y` is the value being appended to the list. 
<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->

3. Write a function, `divides`, that accepts two integers, $a$ and $b$, and returns a boolean indicating whether $a | b$.  Use to test whether $a | bc$ implies $a | b$ or $a | c$.  Test whether $ab | c$ implies that $a | c$ and $b | c$.  

<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
4. Generate code to test whether the square of any odd integer has the form $8m + 1$ for some integer $m$.  

<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
5. The factorial function is defined for $n \ge 0$ as the product $n! = n \cdot (n-1) \cdots 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1$.  Is $n! + 2$ divisible by $2$ for all $n \ge 0$?  Make a conjecture based on your computations by checking for several values of $n$.  You will need your factorial function from a previous lab. 

<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
6. Write a function that returns the result of the following sum:
$$
\frac{1}{2!} + \frac{2}{3!} + \frac{3}{4!} + \cdots + \frac{n}{(n+1)!}
$$
What is the sum for larger and larger values of $n$?   

<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
7. Write a function that returns the sum of the first $n$ integers.  That is, 
$$
1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n .
$$
Modify your function to allow arbitrary starting values, e.g., $7$, 
$$
7 + 8 + 9 + \cdots + n
$$

<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
8. Write a function that computes the sum of positive odd integers, 
$$
1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2n-1).
$$
Verify this sum is equal to $n^2$ for various values of $n$.  

<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
9. Find the smallest set of $n$ consecutive composite integers for each positive integer $n \le 10$.

<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->
10.  Find all integers $n$ between $1$ and $100$ for which $7n \equiv 3\; (\rm{mod }\; 17)$ .


<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
The Fibonacci sequence is $1,1,2,3,5,8,\dots$, where $f_n = f_{n-1}+f_{n-2}$.  Determine which Fibonacci numbers are divisible by are divisible by 5, by 7, and by 11.  Make a conjecture and attempt to prove your conjecture.
 
1.  Find all integers $n$ between $1$ and $100$ for which $7n \equiv 3\; (\rm{mod }\; 17)$ .

<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
1.  Verify experimentally that $n^4$ is even.  Verify experiementally that $4^n$ is even.  Then prove each.  What can you say about $n^4 + 4^n$?

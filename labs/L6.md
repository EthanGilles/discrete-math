## Overview

In the following code exercises you will be asked to "show" or "prove" various formulas or properties.  Mathematical induction is used in the textbook exercises, however, here you will only generate evidence of their truth. A `for` loop (or recursive function) will be necessary for each problem. 

## Learning Objectives
* Verify several mathematical formulas
* Code `for` loops
* Write recursive functions


## Problems

1. For various values of $n$, compute
$$
\frac{1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2n-1)}{(2n+1) + (2n+3)+ \cdots + (2n + (2n - 1) } .
$$

2. By using several values for $n$, verify 
$$
2^n < (n+1)!
$$
You will need a function for factorial.  

3. Let $a_1 = 1$ and generate a **sequence** $a_2, a_3, a_4 \dots$ using the recursive relation for $n \ge 2$:
$$
a_n = 5a_{n-1}
$$

4. Show that all amounts greater than or equal to \$8 can be made from \$3 and \$5 bills.  

5. Show that $2^{2n} - 1$ is divisible by $3$ for all $n \ge 0$. 

6. Find the sum for $n = 100$.
$$
\sum_{k=1}^n \left(\frac{k}{k+1} + \frac{n + 1}{n + 2}\right)
$$

7. "Prove" if $p$ is prime and $k$ is an integer with $0 < k < p$, then $\binom{p}{k}$ is divisible by $p$.  

8. Verify the formula holds for any real number $x \ne 1$ by using several values for $n$ and $x$.  
$$
\sum_{k= 1}^n kx^k =  \frac{n x^{n+2}  -  (n+1) x^{n+1}   + x }{(1-x)^2} .
$$

9.  "Show" $\sqrt{n} < \frac{1}{\sqrt{1}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \cdots + \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$.  That is, verify the truth for several values of $n$.

10.  Verify that $n^3 - n$ is divisible by $6$ for each integer $n \ge 0$.

## Descriptions

[Lab 1](https://github.com/jamesquinlan/discrete-math/blob/main/labs/L1.md) - an introduction to Python covering comments (single line and block), assigments and variables, math operations, logical and relational operators, if-then-else statements, loops, lists, random numbers and functions.

[Lab 2](https://github.com/jamesquinlan/discrete-math/blob/main/labs/L2.md) - coding exercises working with sums and products of lists, factorial function, binomial coefficients, Fermat's Little Theorem, greatest common factor, and relatively primeness. 

[Lab 3](https://github.com/jamesquinlan/discrete-math/blob/main/labs/L3.md) - In this lab you will explore conjectures and code (in any language) to solve mathematical problems such as finding a smallest prime factor of a given number or determine the digital sum of a positive integer.

[Lab 4](https://github.com/jamesquinlan/discrete-math/blob/main/labs/L4.md) - Continue working with prime numbers, divisibility, and summation.  Congruence and modulo arithmetic are used in coding exercises.

[Lab 5](https://github.com/jamesquinlan/discrete-math/blob/main/labs/L5.md) - In this lab we will generate terms of a sequence and verify summation formulas.  Python lambda function will be used and various formulas will be tested.

[Lab 6](https://github.com/jamesquinlan/discrete-math/blob/main/labs/L6.md) - Coding exercises will "show" formulas that will be proven in class using mathematical inducation.

[Lab 7](https://github.com/jamesquinlan/discrete-math/blob/main/labs/L7.md) - In class we are moving on to set theory.  Therefore, we will introduce and work with sets and set operations (i.e., union, intersection, and difference) in Python.  Coding exercises will ask that you verify elements belong to a set and test whether one set is a subset of another.  Python dictionaries are also introduced.

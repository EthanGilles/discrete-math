## Overview

In this lab you will verify several set properties covered in last lecture.  You will need a few functions from last lab, i.e., `issubset()` and `complement()`.

## Learning Objectives
* Test and verify subset relations
* Test and verify set identities
* Write, test, and verify DeMorgan's laws.

## Directions

The first couple are from last week's lab. You can copy and paste them.  Use `&` for intersection and `|` for union. Define  `U = set(range(1,N))` as the universal set for some "large" `N`.  Define the following function to generate random sets. 

```
def randset(M):
  list1 = range(1,M)
  n = random.choice(list1)
  S = set(list1)
  for i in range(n):
    x = random.choice(sorted(S))
    S = S - {x}
  return S
  
  # Call, for example, A = randset(20)
```



## Problems


1. Given any two sets, $A$ and $B$, write a function `issubset` that determines whether $A \subseteq B$.  Function should return `True` if all the elements of $A$ are also elements of $B$.  As soon as one element of $A$ is found not to be in $B$, `return False`.

2. Write a function that returns $A^c$ given that $A$ is a subset of the universal set $U$.


3. Verify for any two sets, $A \cap B \subseteq A$ and $A \cap B \subseteq B$.  Use `randset()` to generate the two sets.

4. Verify for any two sets, $A \subseteq A \cup B$ and $B \subseteq A \cup B$.  Use `randset()` to generate the two sets.   

5. Use `randset()` to generate three sets, then verify the transitive property of subsets.
$$
A \subseteq B \land B \subseteq C \Rightarrow A \subseteq C
$$

6. Verify the following set identities:

	a. *Communtative Laws*: $A \cap B = B \cap A$ and $A \cup B = B \cup A$.
	
	b. *Associative Laws*:
	$$
	A \cup (B \cup C) = (A \cup B) \cup C \\ 
	A \cap (B \cap C) = (A \cap B) \cap C 
	$$
	
	c. *Distributive Laws*
	$$
	A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C) \\ 
	A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) 
	$$

	d. *Double Complement*: $(A^c)^c = A$.  Hint: Create a universal set first (see directions).
	
	e. *Idempotent Laws*: For every set $A$, 
	$$
	A \cup A  = A \\ 
	A \cap A = A  
	$$
	
	f. *Set Difference*: $A - B = A \cap B^c$
	
	g. *Absorption Laws*:
	$$
	A \cup (A \cup B) = A \\ 
	A \cap (A \cup B) = A 
	$$

9. Similar to above, verify *DeMorgan's Laws*
	$$
	(A \cup B)^c = A^c \cap B^c \\ 
	(A \cap B)^c  = A^c \cup B^c 
	$$
	
8. Use `len()` to determine the cardinality of a set. Then determine the number of subsets of a randomly generated set.   

9. Write a set comprehension that contains the set of tuples $(x,y)$ for $x \in \{1,2,3\}$ and $y \in \{2,5\}$.



10. The following code will plot Venn diagram.  Test it with several randomly generated sets `A` and `B`.  Does it work for three sets?

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib_venn import venn2

# Create sets for the two circles
A = set([1,2,3,4,5])
B = set([1,3,5,6,7,8])

# Create a Venn diagram with the sets
venn2([A, B], ('A', 'B'))

# Display the Venn diagram
plt.show()
```



<!-- 
3. Write a function `randset(M)` that generates a random set of at most `M` elements.

def randset(M):
  list1 = range(1,M)
  n = random.choice(list1)
  S = set(list1)
  for i in range(n):
    x = random.choice(sorted(S))
    S = S - {x}
  return S
-->

## Overview

Regular expressions (regex), a concise and expressive notation for pattern matching, are pivotal in text processing, parsing, and search operations. Regular expressions can be used to validate data; examples include checking 

* that the ZIP code data contains the proper number of characters.
* a string contains only letters, spaces, apostrophes, and hyphens (e.g., as last names might)
* an email address
* a social security number is of the form: xxx-xx-xxxx.

Regex **can also be used to**:

* Extract data
* Clean data
* Transform data

The `re` module in Python can work with regular expressions. It contains several functions, including `fullmatch()`, `findall()`, `search()`, `sub()` (substitution), and `split()`.  The `match()` function is particularly useful.  Although not necessary for all regular expressions, it is a good habit to prefix them with an `r`.  The most basic form of regex involves matching a sequence of characters in a similar way as you can do with Ctrl-F in a text editor. Here are a few examples of matching patterns using the `re` module.




```
import re

# Example 1:
regex = r'Hello'
text = 'Hello World!'

'True' if re.match(regex,text) else 'False'

# Example 2:
regex = r'[^(04)1..]'
text = '04106'

'True' if re.match(regex,text) else 'False'
```

In Python's `re` module, `re.compile()` compiles a regular expression pattern into a regular expression object. This compiled representation of the regular expression can be used for efficient matching of patterns in strings. The main advantage of using `re.compile()` is that it allows you to reuse the compiled pattern multiple times without recompiling it each time you want to perform a matching operation.



For convenience, some metacharacters are provided in the table below.


| Character | Description                          | Example    |
|-----------|--------------------------------------|------------|
| []        | Set of Characters                    | [a-n]      |
| \         | Escape character or special sequence | \$         |
| .         | Any character (wildcard)             | he..o      |
| ^         | Starts with (exception)              | ^he        |
| $         | Ends with                            | es$        |
| *         | Zero or more occurrences             | hel*o      |
| +         | One or more occurences               | hel+o      |
| ?         | Zero or one occurence                | hel?o      |
| {}        | Exactly specified occurences         | hel{2}o    |
| \|        | Either or                            | dog \| cat |
| ( )       | Group                                | (ab)       |
| \w        | Word  (equivalent [a-zA-Z0-9]        |            |
| \d        | digits                               | [0-9]      |
| \s and \S | Space and Nonspace                   | (ab)       |




## Problems



1. Given the text, "Contrary to popular belief, regex is easy!", search (i.e, `re.search(regex,text)`) for the substring "lar be".  That is, write a regex to find a substring in the text.  *Hint*: You do not have to use metacharacters, qualifiers, or wildcards in this problem.   

 

2. Use `re.sub(regex, replace, text)` to replace "perfect" in the text "cats are perfect" with "purr-fect".  *Hint*: You do not have to use metacharacters, qualifiers, or wildcards in this problem.    


 <!-- new_text = re.sub(regex, "perfect", text)  --> 
  


3. Write a regular expression to check if the text contains (`match`) "http://" or "https://".  *Hint*: use `?` qualifier. <!-- regex = r"https?://" -->



4. Design a regular expression to match strings that start with "cat" or ends with "dog".  Create a few test strings to test its veracity.

 

5. Write a regular expression to match strings that start with "abc" followed by any combination of digits (0-9).  Create a few strings to test its veracity.

 

6. Write a regular expression to match the phone number "123-456-7890".  Rewrite for the format "(123) 456-7890".   Create a few strings to test its veracity.


	<!-- 
	\([0-9]+\).[0-9]+.[0-9]+ 
	[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}
	-->
	


7. Write a regex to detect addresses of the form: "House Number Street Name".  For example, "123 Main St.", "34567 5th Ave.", "8 Weber Way", etc.  Use the character classes: `\d` (which is equivalent to `[0-9]`), `\D` (non-digit character), `\s` (whitespace), `\w` (alphanumeric characters), and `\W` (non alphanumeric characters) to match street address.


8. What are the results of the following code?  Dissect and explain the regex `^(?!.*xyz).*$`.

	```
	import re
	
	regex = re.compile(r'^(?!.*xyz).*$')
	test_strings = ["abc", "123", "xyz123", "abcxyz", "hello world"]
	for string in test_strings:
	  if regex.match(string):
	    print(f'Match found for "{string}"')
	  else:
	    print(f'No match found for "{string}"')
	
	```

8. Write a regular expression to validate a given input string matching the syntax of a for loop in the C programming language. The acceptable syntax is exemplified by patterns like `for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)` or `for(int i=0; i<10;i++)`.

	**Hints**:
	 
	* Utilize `\s*` to account for optional spaces.
	* Employ `\(` and `\)` to match the opening and closing parentheses.
	* `[a-zA-Z_]\w*` is suitable for matching variable names (C identifiers).
	* `\d+` helps match numeric values.
	* `\+\+` is used to match the increment operation.  Why?
	


9. Use the function `generate_words()` below and the regex `01[0-1]*` to generate several words (say 10) from this language.  Some words in this language are 01, 010, 01000, 0111001, 10111111, 011101, and 01010011. Call this function and print the results.   
	
	```
	import re
	import random
	
	def generate_words(pattern, num_words):
	  words = []
	  n = 0
	  while n < num_words:
	  # for _ in range(num_words):
	    word = re.match(pattern, ''.join(random.choice("01") for _ in range(random.randint(1, 10))))
	    if word:
	      words.append(word.group())
	      n = len(words)
	  return words
```
	<!--
	generated_words = generate_words(r'01[0-1]*', 10)
	print(generated_words)
	-->

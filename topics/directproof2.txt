\subsection*{Directions for Writing Proofs of Universal Statements}
Although there are no hard rules, here are some fairly standard styles of proofs.

\begin{outline}[enumerate]
\1 Write the statement (completely).  This also serves as a reference to the reader.

\1 Mark the beginning of the proof with \textit{Proof}, \textbf{Proof}, or \textit{pf}.

\1 Start your proof with the assumptions (analogous to declaring variables and type in a programming language).  For example, ``Suppose $m$ and $n$ are even integers'' or ``Let $x$ be a real number greater than $2$''.

\1 Use complete, grammatically correct sentences.  You may use mathematical equivalent sentences or incorporate symbols into your sentences.  

\1 Any assumption should be prefaced with ``suppose'' or ``assume''.  

\1 Remind the reader what needs to be shown, e.g., ``We must show that...''.  

\1 Justify each step (or assertion) in the proof.  Each assertion should come from the hypothesis, followed by definition, a result of a previous step or theorem using phrases such as ``\textit{by hypothesis}'', ``\textit{by theorem} ...'', ``\textit{by definition} ...'' and so forth.  Use the name or number of a theorem or definition to be specific.


\1 Include words like: \textit{Because}, \textit{Since}, \textit{Then}, \textit{Thus}, \textit{Hence}, \textit{So}, \textit{Therefore}, \textit{Consequently}.

\1 If a previous result is needed, use \textit{recall} or \textit{note}.

\1 Introduce new variables by ``\textit{Let}'', e.g., ``Let $x$ be an integer.  

\end{outline}

\subsection*{Common Mistakes in Proofs}
%  
\begin{outline}[enumerate]

\1 Argue by example.  ``I like pizza, and she likes pizza; therefore, everyone likes pizza.''
% A general statement can never be proven by a few examples, even if those examples are many. 
Note: Looking at examples gives remarkable insight and provides evidence to support the claim; however, it does not constitute proof.
A general statement can never be proven by a few examples, even if those examples are many. 

\1 Begging the question - \textit{assume what is being proven.}  For example, proving the product of odd integers is odd might (erroneously) go like:  ``Suppose $m$ and $n$ are odd integers.  Because the product of odd integers is odd, $mn$ is odd.''

% 

\1 Jumping to a conclusion.  This occurs when a crucial step that needs to be justified is missing.  For example, ``Suppose $m$ and $n$ be arbitrary even integer.  By definition, $m = 2r$ and $n = 2s$ for some integers $r,s$.  Then $m+n = 2r + 2s$ and so is even.  Note that a key step, namely, \hl{$2(r + s)$ where $r+s$ is an integer since the integers are closed under addition}, was left out.  



\1 Using the same letter for different things.  The definition of odd says -- $n$ is odd if an integer $k$ exists such that $n = 2k+1$.  Now, if applying that definition to two odd numbers naively, this could happen:
\begin{quote}
    \textit{Suppose $m$ and $n$ are odd integers.  By definition, $m = 2k+1$ and $n = 2k+1$.}
\end{quote}
Note here the $m = n$, which is likely not the case.  
Continuing this proof would only show that twice an odd is odd, not what was intended.

\1 Confusing what \textit{is} shown and what \textit{remains} to be shown.  

\1 Use ``any'' or ``some''.

\1 Misuse of ``\textit{if}'' instead of ``\textit{because}'', e.g., ``Suppose $p$ is prime.  Now, \textbf{if} $p$ is prime, then $p$ cannot be written as a product of two smaller positive integers.''  The ``primness'' of $p$ is in doubt.

\begin{example}
The difference between any odd integer and any even integer is odd.

\pf Suppose $a$ is any odd integer and $b$ is any even integer.  By definition, there are integers $r$ and $s$ such that $a = 2r + 1$ and $b = 2s$.  Then, 
\begin{align*}
    a - b   &= 2r+1 - 2s \\
            &= 2r - 2s + 1 \\
            &= 2(r-s) + 1
\end{align*}
Because the integers are closed under subtraction, $r - s \in \Z$, therefore $a - b$ is odd by definition of odd.
\end{example}

\subsection*{Showing an Existential Statement is False}

The negation of an existential statement is a universal statement.  Therefore, one way to show an existential statement is false is to prove its negation is true.  

\[
\neg\ \exists x : P(x) \equiv \forall x : \neg\ P(x)
\]

\1 Prove every integer $m$, if $m$ is even then $3m+5$ is odd.

    % Answer
    \if \sols1
    {\color{blue}
    Suppose $m = 2k+1$ for some $k \in Z$, then $3m+5 = 3(2k+1) + 5 = 6k + 8 = 2(3k+4) = 2M$ where $M = 3k+4 \in \Z$.

\1 Prove if $a$ and $b$ are any odd integers, then $a^2 + b^2$ is even.

    % Answer
    \if \sols1
    {\color{blue}
    Suppose $a = 2k + 1$ and $b = 2j+1$ for (some) $k,j \in \Z$.  It follows that 
    \[ 
    a^2 + b^2 = (2k+1)^2 + (2j+1)^2 = 4(k^2 + j^2) + 4(k+j) + 2 = 2M
    \]
    where $M = 2(k^2 + j^2) + 2(k+j) + 1 \in \Z$.  
    Hence, $a^2 + b^2$ is even.

\1 Disprove the statement: ``There exists an integer $n$ such that $6n^2 + 27$ is prime.''

    % Answer
    \if \sols1
    {\color{blue}
    The statement written with quantifiers is, 
    \[
    \exists n \in \Z : 6n^2 + 27 \text{ is prime.}
    \]
    We instead prove, 
    \[
    \forall n \in \Z, 6n^2 + 27 \text{ is composite.}
    \]
    We have $6n^2 + 27 = 3(2n^2 + 9)$.  That is, we have a factor, $p = 3$ such that  $1 < p < 6n^2 + 27$.  Note: $1 < 9 < 2n^2 + 9 < 6n^2 + 27$.

    \pf Let $m = 2k$ for some $k \in \Z$ and $n \in \Z$ be arbitrary.  The product, $m n = 2(kn)$.  Since the integers are close under multiplication, $kn \in \Z$, therefore $m n$ is even by definition.

\1 Prove or give a counterexample: ``The difference of any two even integers is even.''

    % Answer
    \if \sols1
    {\color{blue}
     \pf Let $m = 2k$ for some $k \in \Z$ and $n = 2j$ for $j \in \Z$.  We have, 
     \[
     m - n = 2k - 2j = 2(k-j) .
     \]
     Since $\Z$ is closed under addition, $k - j \in \Z$, thus by definition, $m - n$ is even.

% 36
\1 Prove or give a counterexample: ``The difference of the squares of any two consecutive integers is odd.''

    % Answer
    \if \sols1
    {\color{blue}
    Let $m = 2k \pm 1$ and $n = 2k$ for $k \in \Z$.  It follows, 
    \[
    m^2 - n^2 = (4k^2 \pm 4k + 1)  - 4k^2  = 1 \pm 4k =  2(\pm2k) + 1. 
    \]
    Since $\pm 2k \in \Z$, by definition the difference is odd.
    We could also reverse the difference.  
    \[
    n^2 - m^2 = -1 \mp 4k = \mp 4k -1 = 2(\mp 2k +1 - 1) -1 = 2(\mp2k -1) + 1.
    \]
    Now since $\mp2k - 1 \in \Z$, we have $n^2 - m^2$ is also odd.
